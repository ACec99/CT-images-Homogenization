## CT-images-Homogenization

Computed Tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role in medical diagnosis; however, variability across reconstruction kernels hinders data-driven approaches, such as deep learning models, from achieving reliable and generalized performance. To this end, **CT data harmonization** has emerged as a promising solution to **minimize such non-biological variances by standardizing data across different sources or conditions**. In this context, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proved to be a powerful framework for harmonization, framing it as a style-transfer problem. However, GAN-based approaches still face limitations in capturing complex relationships within the images, which are essential for effective harmonization. In this work, we **propose a novel texture-aware StarGAN for CT data harmonization, enabling one-to-many translations across different reconstruction kernels**. Although the StarGAN model has been successfully applied in other domains, its potential for CT data harmonization remains unexplored. Furthermore, our approach introduces a multi-scale texture loss function that embeds texture information across different spatial and angular scales into the harmonization process, effectively addressing kernel-induced texture variations. We conducted extensive experimentation on a publicly available dataset, utilizing a total of 48667 chest CT slices from 197 patients distributed over three different reconstruction kernels, demonstrating the superiority of our method over the baseline StarGAN.
